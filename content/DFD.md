Introducing Document Freedom Day
--------------------------------

The first official announcement of the Document Freedom Day: Introducing
the Document Freedom Day: "On 26 March 2008, the Document Freedom Day
will provide a global rallying point for Document Liberation and Open
Standards. It will literally give teams around the world the chance to
"hoist the flag": A 'DFD Starter Pack' containing a flag, t-shirt,
leaflets and stickers is in preparation and is planned to be sent out in
the first weeks of March to the first 100 teams that sign up. Sixteen
teams already signed up during the preparation phase of the DFD prior to
this release. Sign your team up now!"
